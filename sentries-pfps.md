## Why _Sentries_?

When designed properly, **NFTs and mints can super-charge community building, raise startup capital, and align stakeholders towards value creation.** In addition, **Profile Picture (PFP) NFTs** enable both **individual and communal online identities** on social media**.**

Oh, and they're **FUN to collect.**

**Infrastructure investments don't have to be boring.**

## How _Sentries_?

1\. **Quality**: **** Crisp linework, vibrant yet balanced palettes, and bold cell-shading make each Sentry's features pop at a glance.

2\. **Recognizable**: Sentries' unique design and body shape give them a silhouette that is easily differentiated from other PFP collections.

3\. **Unique**: Each Sentry is different enough from the rest to give them their own unique personality. This makes it easier for holders to use and bond to their PFP.

4\. **Clean**: Packing too much detail into a PFP can make the art feel busy and less memorable.

5\. **Numerous**: A 10K supply collection enables a large community, affordable mint pricing, and strong secondary market volumes.

6\. **Sub-DAO Friendly**: The Sentries collection includes rare, easily recognizable traits that can form the basis for community sub-DAOs, similar to Alien SMBs or Coral OKBs.

7\. **Charming**: They're cute and cool, a great combination for broad appeal.
