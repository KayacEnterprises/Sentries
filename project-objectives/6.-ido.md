# 4. Power Staking

All of the Public can stake SOL in The Lode and receive a competitive validator APY. However, S**entry-holders will have access to a more profitable form of staking**: **Power Staking.**

In their metadata, each Sentry has a Power trait. **The Power value represents the amount of SOL backing that particular Sentry**.\
\
Each Sentry minted will start with a Power value of 0. This Power value can be increased by 1 for each SOL locked into The Lode. I.E. **1 Power = 1 SOL.**\
\
Sentries can be staked to receive passive income equivalent to 0% commission staking of their SOL backing.
