# 4. Power Staking

All of the Public can stake SOL in The Lode and receive a competitive validator APY. However, **Sentry-holders will have access to a more profitable form of staking**: **Power Staking.**

In their metadata, each Sentry has a Power trait. **The Power value represents the amount of SOL backing that particular Sentry**.\
\
Each Sentry minted will start with a Power value of 0. **A Sentry's Power can be increased by 1 for each SOL locked into The Lode.**\
****\
******Sentries can be staked in the Power Grid** to receive **passive income, in SOL**, proportional to their Power value in relation to the total Power staked in the Grid.\
\
The Power Grid is funded by:

* 100% of the APY from the SOL backing of Powered-up Sentries.
* Revenue Share from our RPC Nodes and B2B Services.
* Infusions from The Lode as it gains more delegated stake and self-stake APY.

At certain Power thresholds Sentry holders will also unlock additional perks, including visual upgrades.
