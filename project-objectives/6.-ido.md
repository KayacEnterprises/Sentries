# 4. Power Staking

All of the Public can stake SOL in The Lode and receive a competitive validator APY. However, **Sentry-holders will have access to a more profitable form of staking**: **Power Staking.**

In their metadata, each Sentry has a Power trait. **The Power value represents the amount of SOL backing that particular Sentry**.\
\
Each Sentry minted will start with a Power value of 0. **A Sentry's Power can be increased by 1 for each SOL locked into The Lode.**\
\
The APY produced by this SOL locked in The Lode will be funneled to the **Power Grid**.

In addition, a portion of our B2B Services profits will be also funneled to the Power Grid.\
\
**Sentries can be staked in the Power Grid to receive passive income, in SOL**, proportional to their Power value in relation to the total Power staked in the Grid.
