# 5. SYNC

The **strongest Web3 communities** are those that can act in unison, **synchronized** as one. We employ a number of strategies to incentivize this behaviour.

**Discord Sync Ranks:** Obtain and Upgrade Whitelist spots by participating in high quality discussion and helping us spread the word about Sentries.

**Whitelist Tiers:**

* Basic WL: 1 Mint, not guaranteed
* Guaranteed WL x1
* Guaranteed WL x2
* Guaranteed WL x3

**Flex-&-Earn:** Earn Rewards for using your Twitter. More info coming soon.

**B2B Referral Program**: Earn Rewards for referring **B2B Services** clients to Sentries, with bonuses depending on the number of **Sentries** held and their **Power**.
