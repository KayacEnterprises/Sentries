# 2. SYNC

## SYNCHRONIZATION

The **strongest Web3 communities** are those that can act in unison, **synchronized** as one. We employ a number of strategies to incentivize this behaviour.

**Lode Link NFTs** are one of these incentives. **Once our Sentries** mint begins, the Admin Team will carry out a **Synchronization Snapshot:** a series of snapshots at random intervals over 24 hours.

Once a wallet holding a Sentries PFP appears in any of these snapshots, it must appear in **every subsequent snapshot** to be **eligible** for the **Lode Link Airdrop.**

**Royalties:** 7% (4% Admin Team / 3% Sentry Holders)
