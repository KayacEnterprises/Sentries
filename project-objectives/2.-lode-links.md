# 2. Lode Links

## SYNCHRONIZATION

The **strongest Web3 communities** are those that can act in unison, **synchronized** as one. We employ a number of strategies to incentivize this behaviour.

**Lode Link NFTs** are one of these incentives. **Once our Sentries** mint begins, the Admin Team will carry out a **Synchronization Snapshot:** a series of snapshots at random intervals over 24 hours.

Once a wallet holding a Sentries PFP appears in any of these snapshots, it must appear in **every subsequent snapshot** to be **eligible** for the **Lode Link Airdrop.**

**Royalties:** 7% (4% Admin Team / 2% [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md) / 1% [**Power Grid**](3.-power-blocks.md#power-grid))

## LODE LINK UTILITY

Holding a **Sentry+Lode Link pair** will be **required for future airdrop eligibility** as well.

Once _**Sentries**_ reach a [**NFTInspect**](https://www.nftinspect.xyz/rank) **"PFPs per NFT"** rating of **5%**, a **Blue** [**Power Block**](3.-power-blocks.md) will be airdropped for **each unlisted Sentry+Lode Link pair** held.

**Future Airdrops** will also require holding a Sentry+Lode Link pair.

Lode Links are available in three **Types**, which provide **access to different** [**Advanced Functions**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md) **in The Lode:**

* Type A: Block Generator
* Type B: Block Fuser
* Type C: Block Furnace

**Sub-Grid Control** is a rare Lode Link trait that enables the operation of [**Sub-Grids**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md#sub-grids).
