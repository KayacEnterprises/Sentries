# 5. B2B Services

## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

As Web3 gains prevalence and more companies and development teams will require blockchain infrastructure to support their websites and applications.

That is why, at its core, _**Sentries**_ is a **Blockchain Infrastructure company** not just an NFT project.

Solana's Proof-of-History consensus mechanism has the potential to scale sufficiently for mass adoption.&#x20;



Our operational budget will be supplemented by revenue from our **validator and RPC node services.**



## POWER BLOCK FEES

Service contracts will require a part of the costs to be paid in Power Blocks to help support their market demand. Power Blocks collected will be transferred to the SentryDAO treasury.

## REFERRAL COMMISSION PROGRAM

Sentry holders are incentivized to scout for and refer clients to Sentries B2B services via commission payouts. This will transforms our community into a thousands-strong field marketing team.

80% of the commission will be paid to the referrer and 20% to the SentryDAO treasury.
