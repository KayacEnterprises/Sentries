# 5. B2B Services

## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

Sentries wishes for all web3 companies to be able to easily interface with the blockchain and technologies they are building on. Therefore our expertise will be offered as a service to support the **setup and maintain validators for other web3 projects**. This can be a critical piece of revenue for projects and works to secure and decentralize the network, we want to make it as accessible as it can be.

Operating with the UX in mind, another key piece is ensuring speedy access to the blockchain through RPCs. Sentries will also support **deploying RPCs as a service for projects in web3**. Our focus on load balanced, geo distributed deployments ensure that the users of the project have the smoothest experience on Solana.

## POWER BLOCK FEES

Service contracts will require a part of the costs to be paid in Power Blocks to help support their market demand. Power Blocks collected will be transferred to the SentryDAO treasury.

## REFERRAL COMMISSION PROGRAM

Sentry holders are incentivized to scout for and refer clients to Sentries B2B services via commission payouts. This will transforms our community into a thousands-strong field marketing team.

80% of the commission will be paid to the referrer and 20% to the SentryDAO treasury.
