# 5. B2B Services

## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE



## POWER BLOCK FEES

Service contracts will require a part of the costs to be paid in Power Blocks to help support their market demand. Power Blocks collected will be transferred to the SentryDAO treasury.

## REFERRAL COMMISSION PROGRAM

Sentry holders are incentivized to scout for and refer clients to Sentries B2B services via commission payouts. This will transforms our community into a thousands-strong field marketing team.

80% of the commission will be paid to the referrer and 20% to the SentryDAO treasury.
