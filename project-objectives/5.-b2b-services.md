# 5. B2B Services

## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

Today, internet service providers (ISPs) own the network infrastructure on which Web2 operates and command great social, financial, and political power because of it.

As Web3 gains prevalence and adoption accelerates, blockchain infrastructure providers will take up a similar place in the world economy.

That is why, at its core, _**Sentries**_ is a **Blockchain Infrastructure corporation.** Our goal is to become the **biggest and most culturally-relevant infratructure service provide**r

Solana's Proof-of-History consensus mechanism has the potential to scale sufficiently for mass adoption.&#x20;



Our operational budget will be supplemented by revenue from our **validator and RPC node services.**



## POWER BLOCK FEES

Service contracts will require a part of the costs to be paid in [**Power Blocks**](3.-power-blocks.md) to help support their market demand. Power Blocks collected will be transferred to the SentryDAO treasury.

## REFERRAL COMMISSION PROGRAM

Sentry holders are incentivized to scout for and refer clients to Sentries B2B services via commission payouts. This will transforms our community into a thousands-strong field marketing team.

80% of the commission will be paid to the referrer and 20% to the SentryDAO treasury.
