## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

Today, internet service providers (ISPs) own the network infrastructure on which Web2 operates and command great social, financial, and political power because of it.

As Web3 gains prevalence and adoption accelerates, blockchain infrastructure providers will take up a similar place in the world economy. That is why, at its core, _**Sentries**_ is a **Blockchain Infrastructure corporation.**

Our goal is to become the **biggest, most culturally-relevant Web3 infrastructure service provider** and ensure our client projects provide their users with **the smoothest experiences on Solana.**

Our operational budget will be supplemented by revenue from our **Solana** **validator and RPC node services.** These include:

* **Hardware procurement**
* **Set-up**
* **Maintenance & Support**
* **UI/UX**

## RETAIL NODES

Our hardware and automated trading expertise allow us to provide the **fastest and smoothest private Solana RPC node service** available to retail users.

The **top 20 Power Block holders** will have access to our **private RPC/Validator Node free of charge.**

**Subscription spots** will be available to the **next top 230 Power Block holders**.

Node Spot holders that do not wish to use it may rent it out to others.
