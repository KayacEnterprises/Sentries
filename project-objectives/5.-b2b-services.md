## BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE

Today, internet service providers (ISPs) own the network infrastructure on which Web2 operates and command great social, financial, and political power because of it.

As Web3 gains prevalence and adoption accelerates, blockchain infrastructure providers will take up a similar place in the world economy. That is why, at its core, _**Sentries**_ is a **Blockchain Infrastructure corporation.**

Our goal is to become the **biggest, most culturally-relevant Web3 infrastructure service provider** and ensure our client projects provide their users with **the smoothest experiences on Solana.**

Our operational budget will be supplemented by revenue from our **Solana** **validator and RPC node services.** These include:

* **Hardware procurement**
* **Set-up**
* **Maintenance & Support**
* **UI/UX**
