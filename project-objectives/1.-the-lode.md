# 1. The Lode

## IGNITION

Set up and operated by our CTO, [0xNalloK](https://twitter.com/0xTuti), **The Lode** will be a _**Sentries**_**-branded Solana Validator.** It will act as a sustainable foundation and liquidity reserve for the rest of the _**Sentries**_ **ecosystem**.

**At least** **5,000 SOL** from our _Sentries_ PFP Mint will be self-staked into The Lode. This produces enough SOL revenue to break even on its setup and operation costs.

The rest of the project treasury will be converted to USDC post-mint.

Over the next 12 months, **at least 2,000 SOL** will be purchased and staked into The Lode by dollar-cost-averaging treasury funds into SOL at favourable times in the $18-$35 range. The net revenue from SOL self-staking in The Lode will be injected into the [**Power Grid**](3.-power-blocks.md).

**This ignition strategy will allow **_**Sentries**_** to stay active during the bear market AND accumulate cheap SOL for the next bull run.**

## SCALING&#x20;

Once The Lode is ignited, **0% commission SOL staking** will be available for those who hold a [**Sentry**](../sentries-pfps.md) AND a [**Lode Link**](2.-lode-links.md).

SOL staking will be available to the **public at a 7% commission rate**.  The Solana Foundation alone can be expected to delegate 25,000 SOL once application to their program is processed.

Our **Marketing Team** will work with our **Design Team** and the **SentryDAO** to ensure The Lode is **the most culturally relevant Solana validator on the market.**

The Lode's **commission revenue will be injected into the** [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md) **treasury**.
