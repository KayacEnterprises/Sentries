# 1. The Lode

## IGNITION

Set up and operated by our CTO, [0xNalloK](https://twitter.com/0xTuti), **The Lode** is a **** [**Solana Validator now available for staking**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/LodezVTbz3v5GK6oULfWNFfcs7D4rtMZQkmRjnh65gq) on Mainnet and Testnet (for developers that need it)**.** It will act as a revenue source and liquidity reserve for the rest of the _**Sentries**_ **ecosystem**.

**5,000 SOL** from our [_**Sentries**_** PFP**](../sentries-pfps.md) Mint will be self-staked into The Lode. This will produce enough SOL revenue to break even on its setup and operation costs.

The rest of the project treasury will be converted to USDC post-mint.

The rest of the mint funds will be used to fund development of the Sentries ecosystem, including the **Power Staking** sytem.

The stability provided by The Lode acts as a strong foundation on which to build our **Business-2-Business Services**, **Retail RPC Node Services**, and **Gamified Staking** systems.
