# 1. The Lode

Set up and operated by our CTO, [0xNalloK](https://twitter.com/0xTuti), **The Lode** is a **** [**Solana Validator now available for staking**](https://solanabeach.io/validator/LodezVTbz3v5GK6oULfWNFfcs7D4rtMZQkmRjnh65gq) on Mainnet and Testnet (for developers that need it)**.** It will act as a revenue source and liquidity reserve for the rest of the _**Sentries**_ **ecosystem**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/WebSample3.jpg)

The Lode will hold a Self-Stake of:

* **5,000 SOL** from our [_**Sentries**_** PFP**](../sentries-pfps.md) Mint
* 100% of APY from the above 5K SOL.
* 100% of delegated SOL stake commissions.
* 3.5% secondary royalties on Sentries PFPs.

This will produce enough SOL revenue to cover its operation and still have remainder to add to the self-stake.

The stability provided by The Lode acts as a strong foundation on which to build our **Business-2-Business Services**, **Retail RPC Node Services**, and **Power Staking** systems.
