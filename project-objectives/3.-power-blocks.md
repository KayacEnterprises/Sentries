# 3. Power Blocks

## VALIDATOR-BACKED TOKENS

**Power Blocks** are a unique type of SPL token which we are calling **Meta-Fungible Tokens** (MFTs), for lack of a better term.

These tokens have a mint authority and metadata similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) yet are fungible in nature. This allows them to have traits and royalties like NFTs yet still transferable in bulk in a single transaction.

Each **Power Block** has a **Power Rating** **trait** that corresponds to an **amount of SOL staked in** [**The Lode**](1.-the-lode.md) **by** [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md)**.**

**If the SentryDAO ever votes to shut down The Lode, all Power Block holders will be able to burn their Blocks for an amount of SOL equal to their Power Rating.**

A **2% royalty** is encoded into Power Blocks' metadata, the revenue of which will be injected into the **Power Grid**.

## POWER GRID

The Power Grid is a **Power Block staking platform** that dispenses **SOL rewards** proportional to the share of Power Rating staked. These rewards are funded by the following:

* \~7% APY from Power Block SOL backing staked in The Lode
* 2% royalty on Power Block secondary sales
* 1% royalty on **** [**Sentries PFP**](../sentries-pfps.md) **** secondary sales
* 1% royalty on[ **Lode Link** ](2.-lode-links.md)secondary sales
* 20% of [**Sub-Grid**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md#sub-grids) fees
* **SentryDAO** treasury injections

## POWER LIQUIDITY

To **access the underlying liquidity** of their Power Blocks, holders can list them for sale on the **Power Market**, a **0% fee marketplace exclusively for Power Blocks**.

The Power Market will be **available to the public**.

**Lode Link \[Type C] holders** can also unlock the underlying liquidity of their Power Blocks by **burning** them in the[ **Block Furnace**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md#block-furnace)**.**

**Gold Power Block** holders will have the additional option of using their Blocks as **loan collateral**.

## GOVERNANCE BOOST

Holding Power Blocks also grants additional Votes in [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md) governance. More Power Rating held provides more Votes.

## AIRDROP UNLOCKS

A **second Power Block Airdrop** will occur at an **NFT Inspect "PFPs per NFT"** rating of **10%.**

Additional community airdrops and rewards will be unlocked at further NFTInspect rating milestones.
