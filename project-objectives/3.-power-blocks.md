# 3. Power Blocks

## VALIDATOR-BACKED TOKENS

**Power Blocks** are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Solana network.

Each **Power Block** has a **Power Rating** **trait** that corresponds to an **amount of SOL staked in** [**The Lode**](1.-the-lode.md) **by** [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md)**.**

**If the SentryDAO ever votes to shut down The Lode, all Power Block holders will be able to burn their Blocks for an amount of SOL equal to their Power Rating.**

A 3**% royalty** is encoded into Power Blocks' metadata, the revenue of which will be injected into the **Power Grid**.

## POWER GRID

The Power Grid allows holders to stake **Power Blocks** for **SOL rewards** proportional to the share of Power Rating staked. These rewards are funded by the following:

* \~7% APY from Power Block SOL backing staked in The Lode.
* 2% royalty on Power Block secondary sales.
* 1% royalty on [**Sentries PFP**](../sentries-pfps.md) secondary sales.
* 1% royalty on[ **Lode Link** ](2.-lode-links.md)secondary sales.
* 20% of [**Sub-Grid**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md#sub-grids) fees.

## POWER LIQUIDITY

**Sentry+Lode Link \[Type C] holders** can unlock the underlying liquidity of their Power Blocks by **burning** them in the[ **Block Furnace**](4.-advanced-lode-functions.md#block-furnace)**.**

**Sentry + Lode Link** **holders** will have the additional option of using their Solana and Gold Tier Power Blocks as **loan collateral**.

## GOVERNANCE BOOST

Holding Power Blocks also grants additional Votes in [**SentryDAO**](../sentry-dao.md) governance. More Power Rating held provides more Votes.

Additional community airdrops and rewards will be unlocked at further NFTInspect rating milestones.
