# 2. Retail RPC Nodes

**RPC Nodes** are type of high-performance servers that allows users and applications to communicate with validator nodes. Traders and companies pay good money for reliable RPC services that can provide the best performance for their trading bots and applications.

We will use part of our mint funds to develop a **permissionless, on-demand, RPC Node access system**.

This system will be available to the public at the default pricing, while **Sentry holders will receive discounted access based on the number of Sentries held**.
