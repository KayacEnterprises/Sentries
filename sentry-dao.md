# SENTRY DAO

## PURPOSE

While the Admin Team focuses on technical and business development, the SentryDAO will focus on:

* Mobilizing the community on social media.
* Organizing Online and IRL events, marketing, and collabs.
* Scouting for _Sentries_ B2B Services clients.
* Hunting Alpha and Whitelist collabs.

## FORMATION

Once the project mints out, on-chain voting will be established to elect a Sentry Council to:

* manage and delegate SentryDAO activities.
* manage the SentryDAO treasury.
* formally express holder sentiment and proposals to the Admin Team.

The SentryDAO Council must doxx to the Admin Team.

## FUNDING

Quality work requires funds. As such, the SentryDAO Treasury will be funded via the following:

* 2% Sentries PFP secondary sales royalties
* 2% Lode Link secondary sales royalties
* 100% of The Lode delegated stake commissions
* 20% of B2B Service referral commissions
* B2B Service Power Block payments

The Treasury's multi-sig wallets will be managed using [**Snowflake.so**](https://snowflake.so/)****
